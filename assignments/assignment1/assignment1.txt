int a1; b2; // error
  - lexical, since the lexer wouldn't be able to split "b2" into tokens
int arr[10]  //error
  - syntactical, since the ";" is missing, which is caught by the parser
long f#r, nx; //error
  - lexical, since the lexer can't determine what "f#r" means
int do ;  //error
  - syntactical, since "do" is invalid as a variable name
arr[1] = x;  //error
  - static semantic, since "x" is undefined
do = chg(a); //error
  - static semantic, since "a" is the wrong type, and would be caught by the analyzer
return do; //error
  - syntactical, since again "do" is invalid as a name
if (fr = 0) {  //error
  - logical, since this is valid but not logically correct
x = 10; //error 
  - static semantic, since x is not defined
arr[a] = 10; //error
  - uncheckable, since the value of "a" is out-of-bounds
arr[1] = 1; //error
  - syntactical, since there's a missing "}"
