    Overloading means the programmer will write a separate subroutine for
    each type. Generics means the compiler will create a version of the 
    subroutine to match the type needed. Overloading is referred to as 
    "ad hoc" polymorphism because of the similarity between the calling
    syntaxes.

    Inline subroutines are purely an implementation technique, and does
    not affect the meaning of the program. Macros are the opposite, and 
    are semantically preferrable.

7. p 421 (9.2) CYU 12
   Compilers will expand code in-line if it makes the nested invocations
   true subroutine call. This will optimize the code by eliminating half
   the dynamic calls at runtime.
